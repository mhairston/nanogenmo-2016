A core text in the form of a lecture by a fictional professor concerning indeterminate creative techniques, which is then itself subjected to those techniques. 

"Randomness, as it turns out, doesn't' exist. A physicist might tell you that _indeterminacy_ does, at least at a quantum way. But what you are perceiving as randomness is simply the conflagration of a large number of variables. When a system reaches a certain threshold of complexity, the human capacity for intuitively connecting the variables with the outcome is exceeded."

"So, the artist need only choose a small number of variables, and some means of cycling or choosing between alternative values, and a surprising (perceived) complexity of behavior ensues.

An _infinite_ future history of possibilities, that is gradually converted to past history in a futile, but, one hopes, entertaining or beautiful or provocative or sublime attempt to exhaust _forever_.

## The Granularity of Indeterminacy

"We are examining the nature of works of art (or design or communication) in which selected portions (or perhaps the whole!) are unfixed, which is to say, some indeterminate process takes part in their making, or chooses between alternate pieces of fixed content. 

"If one were to consider the whole spectrum of indeterminacy in terms of granularity, that is, the size  of the chunks of unfixed content, we would find that on one end, we might have a writer who composes two separate stories, and an algorithm that simply chooses between them. Not very interesting, more like a publishing decision left to a machine. 

"At the other end, imagine a story in which every letter had been left to chance procedures. Perhaps even the letterforms themselves are indeterminate. Here we have a different problem: the work has been stripped of novelty, pattern, and meaning.
